# ICS3U Assignment 1

For this assignment, you will use your knowledge of Python to create a code that uses a formula to compute a result. Depending on the user input, your code will work in different ways.

Temperature Conversion

There are many parts to this assignment. See how far you can get!

1. Create a program that will convert a temperature in Celsius to Fahrenheit. The program should ask the user to enter the temperature in Celsius and should print out the temperature in Fahrenheit to the nearest whole number. Use the equation F= (1.8)*C+32. The conversion should be done in a function called CtoF. [3 marks]

2. Now modify the program so that it will also convert from Fahrenheit to Celsius. This conversion should be done in a function called FtoC. Print out your result to the nearest whole number. You will have to ask the user which conversion they want to do.  (HINT: You will need to use an if statement).  NOTE:  C = (0.55556)*(F-32) [2 marks]

3. Now modify the program so that it checks to make sure valid inputs are made and tells the user if they have entered invalid data.  The program exits when the user enters invalid data. [1 mark]

4. Now modify the program so that if a user inputs invalid data the program will give them a meaningful message and then keep going.  (HINT: You will need a while statement here) [1 mark]

5. Modify the entire program so that it can do multiple conversions, once it does one conversion it asks if you want to do another. (HINT: Again you will need a while loop here) [1 mark]

Use good coding technique throughout (program header, meaningful variable names, comments inside the program when necessary). [2 marks]


TIP:  If you get part 1 working, commit and push the changes to GitHub before continuing to work on part 2. That way you won't mess up your working version when you try to add new features. Repeat this process for the remaining parts.
